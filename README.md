## üìã Instructions

### üíÄ Bosses

Bosses included come from the games listed below.

- Demon's Souls
- Dark Souls
- Dark Souls II
- Dark Souls III
- Bloodborne
- Elden Ring

Bosses that are **part of multi-boss encounters** may or may not be split into separate entries, if they are unique enough to constitute their own entry, e.g. they have different health pools, resistances or their own name.

Bosses that have **multiple phases**, may likewise have several entries, if their resistances changes inbetween fights, e.g. Slave Knight Gael becoming more resistant to dark after first phase.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Damage Types

Below are the damage types used for calculationg the weaknesses and resistances, including the icons used to represent each individual damage type as well as a description, as the names of similar damage types vary throughout the games, e.g. _lightning_ being _bolt_ in Bloodborne. Hence _bolt_ is treated as _lightning_ to simplify the types of damage instead of separating them.
